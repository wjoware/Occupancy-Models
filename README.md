# Occupancy Models
 # Dynamic occupancy models used to predict patterns in when striped bass (Morone saxatilis) were on the Stanislaus River
 # Data was pre-processed by Matthew Peterson (Scientific Director at FISHBIO, Inc.)
 # Models were co-developed by Matthew Peterson & William Ware with input from Tyler Pilger, Ph.D. (FISHBIO) and John Morgan (UC Santa Cruz)
